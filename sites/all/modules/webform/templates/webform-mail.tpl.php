/**
 * @file
 * Customize the e-mails sent by Webform after successful submission.
 *
 * This file may be renamed "webform-mail-[nid].tpl.php" to target a
 * specific webform e-mail on your site. Or you can leave it
 * "webform-mail.tpl.php" to affect all webform e-mails on your site.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - $form_values: The values submitted by the user.
 * - $node: The node object for this webform.
 * - $user: The current user submitting the form.
 * - $ip_address: The IP address of the user submitting the form.
 * - $sid: The unique submission ID of this submission.
 * - $cid: The component for which this e-mail is being sent.
 *
 * The $cid can be used to send different e-mails to different users, such as
 * generating a reciept-type e-mail to send to the user that filled out the
 * form. Each form element in a webform is assigned a CID, by doing special
 * logic on CIDs you can customize various e-mails.
