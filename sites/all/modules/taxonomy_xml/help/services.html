      Services for taxonomy_xml

    <p>
      Taxonomies can be imported from external service providers
      and locations.
      <br />
       A few samples are built-in, and more can be provided by
      additional modules. Most supported services are direct URL
      requests, usually with an identifier in the GET string
      indicating the entry being requested. Others are simply URLs
      (no ID argument needed) where a third-party document can be
      downloaded from, provided as a convenience, or to avoid
      licensing problems, and to ensure you are retrieving the
      latest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two forms of 'service' are currently supported - search and
      lookup. Both services are expected to return some form of
      unique identifer that can be used to locate further terms. A
      search result will return one or more ids that can be
      retrieved by lookup. A lookup may return a term definition
      that includes reference to its parent or child terms. These
      are usually looked up next.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Search Service
    </h3>
    <p>
      Search is intended to take a text string and return a
      resource ID relevant to the service provider. Each service
      has its own form of local ID. It is the job of the service to
      identify the ID from the result and create an appropriate
      lookup request using that ID as a key.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Lookup Service
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lookup is used when you have uniquely identified the resource
      entry to be retrieved, and returns a machine-readable dump of
      that data in one of the supported formats. Often that result
      will contain references to further resources that can be
      retrieved in turn.

      The service definition array is undergoing development.
