                         TAXONOMY CSV IMPORT
                         ===================


-- SUMMARY --
  ---------

This module allows to import taxonomy from a CSV (comma separated values) file.

When you want to import a vocabulary, a taxonomy or a simple list of terms in
your Drupal site, you have two main choices: taxonomy_xml and taxonomy_csv.

Taxonomy XML (http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_xml) is perfect for
standardized taxonomies and vocabularies importation. Despite its name, it can
import csv files too, but only if they are ISO 2788 formated.

So when you want to quick import a non-standardized vocabulary, for example an
old thesaurus or a simple list of children, synonyms, related terms,
descriptions or weights of a set of terms, Taxonomy CSV is simpler to use.

Use at your risk. Even if many informations are displayed, taxonomy_csv module
does not tell you what it's gonna do before it's doing it, so make sure you have
a backup so you can roll back if necessary.
